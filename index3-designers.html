                <h3>charlene petersen</h3>

                <h6>is the principal designer and owner of cashmere interior.</h6>
                <p>
                    Charlene offers a unique background and perspective into the world of interior design. Her
                    childhood was spent in the rural farmland of Chester County, PA with a close knit, hard working
                    family. <br><br>

                    Her life and career experiences have allowed her the opportunity to travel the world and see
                    first hand what other cultures bring to the design arena. These travels and innate sensibilities
                    give her an eye for wonderful one of kind pieces housed within the firm’s inventory.<br><br>

                    Her personality is easy going, down to earth and she has an uncanny ability to determine what a
                    client wants. Charlene’s core design inspiration draws from her metaphorical feeling of cashmere
                    – hence, Cashmere Interior.

                <h6>Designer and Project Manager</h6>
                <p>
                    Holly’s background was heavily rooted in Sport and the Liberal Arts but started her career
                    within
                    the Project Management sphere. Cashmere Interior allowed the perfect opportunity to flex muscles
                    in both the left and right side of her brain.
                    <br><br>
                    Having been born in Canada, lived in the Bahamas, and raised in the UK, her “Jack of All Trades”
                    arsenal and unique upbringing allow her to tap into a greater picture; she values punctuality,
                    teamwork, and communication above all else. She is the first to take the mic at karaoke, and
                    last to leave a board game night, but her greatest goal is to keep those around her – colleagues
                    and clients, alike – happy.

                <h6>Operations Manager</h6>
                <p>Joan has 45 years accounting and operational experience in the design, wholesale, and construction industries.  Her close attention to detail is one of her many attributes.  Often called the “penny pincher”, she would like to point out that “it’s not the penny, it’s the principal”.  In her spare time, she loves to spend time with her family and 4 dogs, and her favorite pastimes are crafting and caring for her plants.  She particularly likes to repurpose materials like the design library’s retired fabrics, leather, and tiles to make unique personalized items for family and friends.</p>
